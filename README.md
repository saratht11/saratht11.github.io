# Portfolio — saratht11.github.io

A fast, responsive portfolio site for GitHub Pages. Built with plain HTML/CSS/JS for zero-dependency hosting.

## Update your details

- Photo: replace `IMG_0779.JPG` if needed (keep the same name or update `index.html`).
- Resume: the button links to `SarathChandarResume (4).pdf`. Change the filename in `index.html` if you rename it.
- Social links: update GitHub and LinkedIn URLs in `index.html`.
- Projects: edit the three sample cards under the `#projects` section.
- Contact email: search for `hello@sarath.dev` and replace with your address.

## Local preview

Open `index.html` directly in a browser, or serve the folder using any static server.

## Deploy on GitHub Pages

This repo is already named like a user site (`<username>.github.io`). Push to `main` and Pages will serve at `https://saratht11.github.io/`.

If Pages is not enabled:
1. Go to Settings → Pages.
2. Source: `Deploy from a branch`.
3. Branch: `main` / root.

## Accessibility & performance

- Accessible color contrast and focus styles.
- Works without JavaScript (JS is only for theme toggle and dynamic year).
- Responsive layout, no external CSS frameworks.

## License
